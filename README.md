*My awesome projects*

## Application and Web Development Projects for School:

### TypeScript & React:

#### Boat reservation application with TypeScript, React and Material UI components
A boat reservation application for a school project, practicing routing, React components, Web API calls and saving data to localStorage. <br>
The application fetches weather information from a Web API and saves data to the localStorage (username, password and reservations).<br>
<i>The application does not follow any safety guidelines, so do not use real usernames or passwords!</i> <br>

### Framer projects:
#### Redesigned User Experience prototype of Ledvances smart light control app
UX design school project where we had to redesign the user experience for any application or website we wanted.
The prototype and it's features do not have a full functionality nor responsivity. It is designed for a mobile device.

#### Used Toys Online Store
UI design school project, where we had to create online store to learn prototyping with Framer. 
As it is only a prototype, it is not fully functioning and e.g. the shopping cart and customer information on check out are already filled in. <br>
