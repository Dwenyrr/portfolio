*My awesome projects*


## Framer projects:
### Redesigned User Experience prototype of Ledvances smart light control app
UX design school project where we had to redesign the user experience for any application or website we wanted.
The prototype and it's features do not have a full functionality nor responsivity. It is designed for a mobile device.

### Used Toys Online Store
UI design school project, where we had to create online store to learn prototyping with Framer. 
As it is only a prototype, it is not fully functioning and e.g. the shopping cart and customer information on check out are already filled in. <br>
